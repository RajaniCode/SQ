NOTE: By default [int IDENTITY(0, 1), PRIMARY KEY] are NOT NULL (CANNOT be declared using NULL)

NOTE: By default [UNIQUE (candidate key)] is NULL, can accept only one NULL (CAN be declared using NULL)
 
NOTE: FOREIGN KEY can REFERENCE both PRIMARY KEY(S)(in different tables) AND UNIQUE (candidate key(s))(in same/different tables)

NOTE: Only one [int IDENTITY(0, 1), PRIMARY KEY, CLUSTERED]  per table is allowed

NOTE: More than one [UNIQUE (candidate key), FOREIGN KEY (reference same/different tables)]  per table are allowed

NOTE: ADD CONSTRAINT [PRIMARY KEY], the column should be NOT NULL
[Otherwise DROP COLUMN, ADD COLUMN]

NOTE: ADD CONSTRAINT [UNIQUE (candidate key), the column need not be NOT NULL

NOTE: FOREIGN KEY need not have same name as that of the PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE (candidate key), which the FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES
[BUT same type and size]
