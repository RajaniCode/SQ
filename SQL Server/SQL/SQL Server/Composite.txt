A composite key has more than one attribute (field). In this example we store details of tracks on albums - we need to use three columns to get a unique key - each album may have more than one disk - each disk will have tracks numbered 1, 2, 3...

The primary key must be different for each row of the table. The primary key may not contain a null.
     
 
DROP TABLE track

CREATE TABLE track(
  album CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  dsk INTEGER NOT NULL,
  posn INTEGER NOT NULL,
  song VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (album, dsk, posn)
)

  
  
Specific to SQL Server 
We must explicitly state that the components are NOT NULL.
