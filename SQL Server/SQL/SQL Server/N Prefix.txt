Why do some SQL strings have an 'N' prefix?
You may have seen Transact-SQL code that passes strings around using an N prefix. This denotes that the subsequent string is in Unicode (the N actually stands for National language character set). Which means that you are passing an NCHAR, NVARCHAR or NTEXT value, as opposed to CHAR, VARCHAR or TEXT. See Article #2354 for a comparison of these data types. 


IF OBJECT_ID (N'dbo.TestTable', N'U') IS NOT NULL 
DROP TABLE dbo.TestTable;
CREATE TABLE dbo.TestTable(Name VARCHAR(100));

EXEC sp_ExecuteSQL N'SELECT Name FROM dbo.TestTable'
