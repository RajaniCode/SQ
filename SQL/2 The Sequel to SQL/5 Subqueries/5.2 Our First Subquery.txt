5.2 Our First Subquery


Let's write our first subquery.


Tables
Movies
id 	title
1 	Don Juan
2 	The Lost World
3 	Peter Pan
4 	Robin Hood
Rooms
id 	seats 	movie_id
1 	50 	2
2 	100 	1
3 	100 	NULL
4 	150 	3


schema.sql
CREATE TABLE Movies (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  title varchar(50) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Movies (id, title) VALUES
  (1, 'Don Juan'),
  (2, 'The Lost World'),
  (3, 'Peter Pan'),
  (4, 'Robin Hood');

CREATE TABLE Rooms (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  seats int,
  movie_id int,
  FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES Movies
);

INSERT INTO Rooms (id, seats, movie_id) VALUES
  (1, 50, 2),
  (2, 100, 1),
  (3, 100, NULL),
  (4, 150, 3);


subquery.sql


1. First, let's write a query that returns every movie_id from the Rooms table that has more than 75 seats.

Answer: SELECT movie_id FROM Rooms WHERE seats > 75


2. Next, turn this query into a subquery by wrapping it in parentheses. Then use the returned ids to find the matching movies and return their titles.

Answer: SELECT title FROM Movies WHERE id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM Rooms WHERE seats > 75);
