1.8 Average Salary


We already know how to find the total sum of everybody’s salaries, but our accountant reached out to us asking for the average salary.


Tables
Actors
name 			country 	salary
Vivien Leigh 		IN 		150000
Clark Gable 		USA 		120000
Olivia de Havilland 	Japan 		30000
Hattie McDaniel 	USA 		45000


1. Write a query that calculates the average salary for all actors in our Actors table.

Answer: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Actors;


2. Now filter the query in order to calculate the average of only American actors.

Answer: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Actors WHERE country = 'USA';
