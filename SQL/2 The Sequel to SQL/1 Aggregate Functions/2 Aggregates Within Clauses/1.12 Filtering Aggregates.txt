1.12 Filtering Aggregates


We need to extract some salary data from the Actors table grouped by each individual country.


Total
Actors
name 			country 	salary 		role
Vivien Leigh 		IN 		150000 		leading
Clark Gable 		USA 		120000 		leading
Olivia de Havilland 	Japan 		30000 		leading
Hattie McDaniel 	USA 		45000 		supporting
Leslie Howard 		UK 		50000 		leading
Alicia Rhett 		USA 		97000 		supporting
Lillian Kemble-Cooper 	UK 		95000 		supporting


schema.sql
CREATE TABLE Actors (
  name varchar(50),
  country varchar(50),
  salary integer,
  role varchar(50)
);

INSERT INTO Actors (name, country, salary, role) VALUES
  ('Vivien Leigh',          'IN',     150000,   'leading'),
  ('Clark Gable',           'USA',    120000,   'leading'),
  ('Olivia de Havilland',   'Japan',  30000,    'leading'),
  ('Hattie McDaniel',       'USA',    45000,    'supporting'),
  ('Leslie Howard',         'UK',     50000,    'leading'),
  ('Alicia Rhett',          'USA',    97000,    'supporting'),
  ('Lillian Kemble-Cooper', 'UK',     95000,    'supporting');


query.sql


1. Use the GROUP BY clause to write a query that returns the country name and total salary paid to actors for each country.

Answer: SELECT country, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM Actors GROUP BY country;


2. Now use the HAVING clause to add a filter so that only countries with more than 1 actor are returned from our SQL query.

Answer: SELECT country, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM Actors GROUP BY country HAVING COUNT(name) > 1;


3. Lastly, let’s add a condition to filter only actors with a supporting role. This condition will need to be run before the grouping of records happen.

Answer:

SELECT country, SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM Actors
WHERE role = 'supporting'
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(name) > 1;
