3.3 Creating a Join Table


Below we can see our Actors and Movies table which now follow our Second Normal Form Rule, meaning there is no redundancy.
Actors
id 	name
1 	Vivien Leigh
2 	Clark Gable
3 	Olivia de Havilland
Movies
id 	title
1 	Don Juan
2 	The Lost World
3 	Peter Pan
4 	Robin Hood
Help

Now we need a join table to map Actors to the Movies they acted in. This should be called the [ ] table.
