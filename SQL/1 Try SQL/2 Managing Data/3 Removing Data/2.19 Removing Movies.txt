2.19 Removing Movies

We need to start removing records from our movies table, which is shown below.
id 	title 		genre 		duration
1 	Metropolis 	Sci-Fi 		153
2 	Nosferatu 	Horror 		94
3 	The Kid 	Comedy 		68
4 	The Gold Rush 	Adventure 	95
5 	The Circus 	Comedy 		68
6 	The Fly 			80

1. I've lost my sense of humor. Please write a SQL statement to DELETE all the movies that have a genre of 'Comedy'.

Answer: DELETE FROM movies WHERE genre = 'Comedy';

2. I also have a short attention span and I hate vampires. Please write a statement to remove all movies that have a duration of greater than 120 minutes or are called 'Nosferatu'.

Answer:

DELETE FROM movies WHERE genre = 'Comedy';
DELETE FROM movies WHERE (duration > 120 OR title = 'Nosferatu');
