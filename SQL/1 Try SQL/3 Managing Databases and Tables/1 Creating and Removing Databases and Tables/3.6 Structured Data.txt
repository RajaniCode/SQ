3.6 Structured Data

We've added a few more rows to the advertisements table, but there are still a few more changes that need to be made. Check out the objectives below.
id 	name 		category 	cost
1 	Poster 		Paper 		20
2 	Billboard 	Paper 		100
3 	Banner Ad 	Web 		35
4 	Commercial 			150

1. It looks like one of the rows is missing some information. Let's write an UPDATE statement to update that row. Set the category of the 'Commercial' row to 'Television'.

Answer: UPDATE advertisements SET category = 'Television' WHERE name = 'Commercial';


2. Uh oh! Our boss just said we don't have the budget for advertisements, so we don't need this table any more. Below your existing code, remove the entire advertisements table.

Answer: 

UPDATE advertisements SET category = 'Television' WHERE name = 'Commercial'; 
DROP TABLE advertisements;
